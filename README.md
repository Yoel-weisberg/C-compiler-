# How to run

in order to run this project you need to have this installed 

    - LLVM (built)
    - cmake
    - msvc compiler (comes with vs)

after cloning the source code from gitlab make sure the cmake is configured based on your LLVM location. 

after everything is set you have two options to compile source files
    
    1. include the source file as a command line argument 
    2. the defualt location is at testFiles/testFile

and then you only need to cmake run the project and an object file would be created
